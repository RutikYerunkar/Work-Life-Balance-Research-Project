->List of Objectives:
1. Analyze the relationships between individual attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score. Determine which attributes have the strongest impact on the overall score and identify potential areas for improvement in work-life balance.

2. Investigate the impact of demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) on specific attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score. Identify potential differences in lifestyle and wellbeing factors across demographic groups.

3. Identify patterns or clusters of individuals with similar lifestyle and wellbeing profiles. Explore the common characteristics of these clusters, including demographic factors, habits, and behaviors, and their implications for work-life balance interventions.

4. Develop a predictive model to estimate an individual's Work_Life_Balance_Score based on their lifestyle, habits, and behaviors. Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques.

5. Examine the associations between specific attribute pairs or groups, such as the relationship between daily stress, daily shouting, and weekly meditation, or between BMI range, daily steps, and fruits and vegetable consumption.

6. Investigate the impact of specific habits, such as time spent on personal passions or meditation, on mental health-related attributes like daily stress and daily shouting.

7. Assess the role of social factors, such as core circle size, social network size, and supporting others, in predicting overall work-life balance and well-being.

Overview of how we can achieve this objectives:
1. Analyzing relationships between attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score:
Calculate correlation coefficients between individual attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score.
Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps) to help identify trends and relationships.

2. Investigating the impact of demographic factors:
Perform grouped analyses by dividing the dataset based on demographic factors like age and gender.
Use statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to determine significant differences in attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score across demographic groups.

3. Identifying patterns or clusters:
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) to identify groups of individuals with similar lifestyle and wellbeing profiles.
Analyze the attributes of each cluster to understand common characteristics and identify potential interventions for improving work-life balance.

4. Developing a predictive model:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate different machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) using cross-validation techniques.
Utilize feature selection methods (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination, LASSO) to identify the most important attributes for prediction.

5. Examining associations between specific attribute pairs or groups:
Conduct bivariate or multivariate analyses to study the relationships between pairs or groups of attributes.
Use visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to explore the relationships between attribute pairs or groups.
Perform statistical tests (e.g., correlation, regression) to quantify the strength and significance of these relationships.

6. Investigating the impact of specific habits on mental health-related attributes:
Analyze the associations between habits (e.g., time for passion, weekly meditation) and mental health-related attributes (e.g., daily stress, daily shouting).
Use regression analysis to quantify the impact of these habits on mental health outcomes.

7. Assessing the role of social factors in predicting work-life balance and well-being:
Investigate the relationships between social factors (e.g., core circle size, social network size, supporting others) and the Work_Life_Balance_Score.
Conduct multivariate regression analyses to determine the combined impact of these social factors on work-life balance and well-being.

->Steps to carry out every objective mentioned above:
# Objective 1:
Data preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset as needed. This might include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing numerical variables.

Exploratory data analysis: Visualize the relationships between individual attributes and the Work_Life_Balance_Score using scatterplots, box plots, or other appropriate plots. Calculate descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients to quantify the relationships.

Feature selection: Use various feature selection techniques to identify the most important attributes that contribute to the Work_Life_Balance_Score. Techniques may include Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), LASSO regularization, or using feature importances from tree-based algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost.

Build a regression model: Train a regression model (such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks) to predict the Work_Life_Balance_Score based on the selected attributes. Perform cross-validation to avoid overfitting and obtain a more accurate performance estimate.

Evaluate model performance: Calculate performance metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), or mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the model's ability to predict the Work_Life_Balance_Score.

Interpret the model: Analyze the coefficients or feature importances from the trained model to determine which attributes have the strongest impact on the Work_Life_Balance_Score. You can also use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to gain more insights into the model's predictions.

Identify areas for improvement: Based on your analysis, identify the attributes with the most significant impact on work-life balance. These attributes will likely represent areas where individuals can make changes to improve their work-life balance. For example, if daily stress is a critical factor, you can suggest interventions or strategies to help people manage stress more effectively.

# Objective 5:
Select the attribute pairs or groups we want to investigate, such as the relationship between daily stress, daily shouting, and weekly meditation, or between BMI range, daily steps, and fruits and vegetable consumption.

Create visualizations to explore the relationships between the selected attributes. Some common visualization techniques include scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots.
For example:
Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables, such as daily stress and weekly meditation.
Use box plots or violin plots to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., daily steps) across different categories of a categorical variable (e.g., BMI range).

Calculate correlation coefficients between pairs of continuous variables to quantify the strength and direction of their linear relationships. For example, compute Pearson's correlation coefficient between daily stress and weekly meditation.

For non-linear relationships or relationships between categorical and continuous variables, consider using other statistical measures such as Spearman's rank correlation or point-biserial correlation.

Perform regression analysis to model the relationships between attributes, accounting for potential confounding factors. For example, we can use multiple linear regression to model the relationship between daily stress, daily shouting, and weekly meditation, while controlling for other variables like age and gender.

Perform statistical tests to determine the significance of the relationships between the attributes. For example, we can use t-tests or ANOVA to compare the means of a continuous variable (e.g., daily steps) across different categories of a categorical variable (e.g., BMI range).

Analyze the interactions between attributes and their combined effects on other variables. For instance, we can use interaction terms in a multiple linear regression model to examine the combined impact of BMI range and fruits and vegetable consumption on daily steps.:Tried few samples but not found any significant difference.

Validate our findings using various techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or out-of-sample testing. This can help us assess the robustness of our conclusions and minimize the risk of overfitting or spurious correlations.
